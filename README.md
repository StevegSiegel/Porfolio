# Portfolio

## Description

We were tasked with creating a portfolio page in order to showcase our work during this boot camp to potential employers. We were to create a page that featured a brief section with information about ourselves, a section to display all of the different projects that we have and will create, as well as a section with contatct information, and a resume. The page had to have a working nav bar to allow users to quickly jump to certain parts of the page. And the links to our various projects, as well as our contact information, were required to be functional. The page was created from scratch using a combination of html and css. Further refinment of the styling required before showing to actual employers, (currently resume link doesn't go anywhere need to explore different options for linking it)
